                Blake Bingham has just finished optometry school and is married with 
                three young girls. He wants to move his family somewhere with fast growing
                businesses, but he also wants his girls to grow up with good schools and 
                lots of fun activities to enjoy. In his search for the perfect place to live,
                Blake finds tricitycommerce.com where the FAQ's tell him that the Tri-cities
                checks off all the boxes he wants in a new home.

                Scott Woods
            </h1>
            <p>
                Scott is an engineer. Him and his wife Angie have lived in the Tri-cities 
                their whole lives with their three children. Scott's children have now all 
                grown up and left the house, leaving Scott and Angie all by themselves.
                Scott loves to spend time with his wife, but she does a lot of service which
                leaves him with time to himself. He thinks it would be fun to find other 
                engineering professionals in the community, connect with them, and maybe even 
                work on a side project with them. He googles "engineers near me" and it brings him 
                to the Tri-city Chamber website where he finds these events:
