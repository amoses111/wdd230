                Visual Hierarchy is the idea that a webpage should be structured
                in a way that presents content in the order of importance. The 
                first content should be eye catching and should draw the viewer 
                in. In this example, Old Navy does a great job at presenting deals
                and limited time offers that they hope the shopper utilize.

                Hick's Law is a function that measures the reaction time that we have to stimuli.
                In web design this is important because if there is too much stimuli, the reaction
                time is greater. Hick's law is the idea that less is more. You don't want to overwhelm
                the viewer and so you should give them less options and make the website simple.
                Moheim is a japanese retailer whose website is minimalistic - much like their products.
                It is not only fitting not only for their services, but also for the message they are giving
                their customers.

                Contrast is one of the PARC principles. Constrast helps bring the user's attention
                to certain details and brings not only beauty, but utility to the website as well.
                The Empathy Experiment utilizes this principle flawlessly and has vibrant colors 
                that help to enrich the user experience and bring awareness to key points.
