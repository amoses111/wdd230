                Visual Hierarchy is the idea that a webpage should be structured
                in a way that presents content in the order of importance. The 
                first content should be eye catching and should draw the viewer 
                in. In this example, Old Navy does a great job at presenting deals
                and limited time offers that they hope the shopper utilize.

                Hick's Law is a function between the reaction time that we have to stimuli.
                In web design this is important because if there is too much stimuli, the reaction
                time is greater. Hick's law is the idea that less is more. You don't want to overwhelm
                the viewer and so you should give them less options and make the website simple.
